# D-008 · Pinned service images: PostgreSQL 18, Redis 8, nginx 1.30

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** `postgres:18-alpine` (volume mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql`,
  the layout that image expects since version 18), `redis:8-alpine`,
  `nginx:1.30-alpine`, `python:3.12-slim`.
- **Why:** Current stable majors, pinned so a rebuild does not change behaviour
  silently. Python 3.12 is the version the spec names.
- **Alternatives:** `latest` tags; an image with pgvector, which is deferred
  until the memory layer needs it (phase 6).
