# D-013 · High Card as a shipped reference game

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** `games/toy` is a real plugin (a small trick-taking game), not a
  test fixture.
- **Why:** It is the game the CLI runs before a real game exists, and the
  template `CLAUDE.md` points to for adding a game.
- **Alternatives:** A fixture under `tests/` only.
