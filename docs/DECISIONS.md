# Decisions

Decisions taken where [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) is open, or where this project
deliberately differs from it. `DESIGN.md` is kept verbatim as the original
spec; where the two disagree, this file wins.

Each entry: date, decision, why, alternatives considered.

## D-001 · Answers to the spec's open questions

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** Frontend is SvelteKit. The in-game language is a per-match
  setting, default German. The default budget is €0.50 per match with a hard
  cap of €5 per month; at a cap the match pauses and asks. The default roster
  is a set of cheap OpenRouter models, listed in `config/models.yaml` when
  model calls land (step 1.5).
- **Why:** Set by the project owner before the build started.
- **Alternatives:** React; a fixed language; per-day instead of per-month cap.

## D-002 · Host ports 8100 / 3100 / 5433 / 6380, bound to 127.0.0.1

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** Arena API on 8100, web UI on 3100, PostgreSQL on 5433, Redis on
  6380. Container ports stay standard. Every published port binds to
  `127.0.0.1`.
- **Why:** Non-default ports avoid clashes with other local stacks and with a
  host-installed Postgres or Redis (the spec says 3000 for the UI). Loopback
  only, because the API has no authentication and will be able to start paid
  matches, and the database uses a development password.
- **Alternatives:** Default ports; binding to all interfaces.

## D-003 · No restart policy in Compose

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** Services have no `restart:` policy.
- **Why:** This is a development and spectator stack that you start on
  purpose. With a restart policy it would come back with every Docker start and
  could resume matches that spend money.
- **Alternatives:** `restart: unless-stopped`.

## D-004 · uv with a lockfile, hatchling, ruff

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** Dependencies are managed with uv and pinned in `uv.lock`; the
  Docker image and CI install with `uv sync --frozen`. The project is an
  installable package (hatchling) containing `arena` and `games`. ruff does
  linting and formatting. `docs/DESIGN.md` is excluded from ruff because the
  spec is kept verbatim.
- **Why:** One lockfile gives the same versions locally, in CI and in the
  image. An installable package is needed for the `arena` command (step 1.6).
  One tool for lint and format keeps CI short.
- **Alternatives:** pip with `requirements.txt`; Poetry; black plus flake8.

## D-005 · Static web placeholder until phase 5

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** The `web` service is nginx serving one static page. The
  SvelteKit app replaces it in phase 5.
- **Why:** The Compose topology and port are fixed from the start, without
  carrying a Node toolchain, lockfile and CI job through four phases that do
  not touch the UI.
- **Alternatives:** An empty SvelteKit scaffold now.

## D-006 · Worker placeholder with a heartbeat healthcheck

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** Until matches exist, the worker only pings Redis every 5 s and
  touches a heartbeat file after each successful ping. Its healthcheck fails
  when the heartbeat is older than 15 s. The worker does not exit when Redis is
  down; it goes unhealthy and recovers on its own.
- **Why:** The healthcheck then tests what matters for a worker (the process is
  alive and reaches its queue) rather than only that a container exists.
- **Alternatives:** No worker service until step 1.6; a healthcheck that opens
  its own Redis connection, which would not notice a hung worker.

## D-007 · Secret scan with a pinned gitleaks image

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** CI scans the full git history with
  `ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks` at a pinned version, run through `docker run`.
- **Why:** The same command runs locally and in CI, with nothing to install
  and no licence key.
- **Alternatives:** `gitleaks-action`; trufflehog; GitHub secret scanning alone.

## D-008 · Pinned service images: PostgreSQL 18, Redis 8, nginx 1.30

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** `postgres:18-alpine` (volume mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql`,
  the layout that image expects since version 18), `redis:8-alpine`,
  `nginx:1.30-alpine`, `python:3.12-slim`.
- **Why:** Current stable majors, pinned so a rebuild does not change behaviour
  silently. Python 3.12 is the version the spec names.
- **Alternatives:** `latest` tags; an image with pgvector, which is deferred
  until the memory layer needs it (phase 6).

## D-009 · Plugins change state only through events

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** The plugin interface differs from the sketch in the spec.
  `setup`, `apply_actions` and `step` get a context and call `ctx.emit(...)`
  instead of returning events; the engine passes every emitted event to a new
  method `apply_event`, the only place where a plugin may mutate its state.
  `initial_state` (pure, no randomness) replaces the state-building half of the
  spec's `setup`. `validate` returns `None` or an error message. `random_action`
  is part of the interface. `render_spec` is left out until the UI defines what
  it needs (phase 5).
- **Why:** If state changes only by applying events, the event log is complete
  by construction: replay is a fold over the log, needs no seed and no rule
  logic, and keeps working for old logs after rules change. Emitting and
  applying in one call means a plugin writes each state change once and can
  read the updated state right away.
- **Alternatives:** Mutating in `apply_actions` and returning descriptive
  events (the log may then silently miss state); storing only actions and
  re-running the rules for replay (breaks old replays when rules change).

## D-010 · Named random streams derived from the seed

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** A plugin gets randomness from `ctx.rng(*key)`, a stream derived
  from the match seed and the key by SHA-256. A key may be used once per match.
  Random bots and the engine fallback use separate streams.
- **Why:** A stream depends only on seed and key, so a match can continue from
  its log without saved generator state, rejected attempts and bot draws cannot
  shift the game's randomness, and a game can deal the same cards again on
  purpose (duplicate poker: key by hand number).
- **Alternatives:** One generator for the whole match (its state must be saved
  to resume, and any extra draw changes everything after it).

## D-011 · Validation order and fallback

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** The engine checks an action in three steps: the tool is offered
  now, the arguments match the tool's JSON Schema (`jsonschema`), the plugin's
  `validate` accepts it. A rejected action is returned with the error; after 2
  corrections the game's `random_action` plays instead and the log marks it
  with `action_fallback`. Every attempt is logged, visible only to that player
  and to spectators.
- **Why:** Generic checks give every game the same clear errors for malformed
  model output, and plugins validate only rules. A random legal move keeps the
  match going in every game without a per-game notion of "do nothing".
- **Alternatives:** A per-game default action; skipping the player's turn.

## D-012 · One engine loop for all turn modes, one action per request

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** The loop is the same for `sequential`, `simultaneous` and
  `tick`: ask all active players at once, apply their actions together, then
  `step`. Sequential games may name at most one active player; tick games may
  name none. An agent returns one action per request; a turn with several
  actions (talk, then play) is the plugin keeping the player active. The engine
  is async. A turn that produces no game event stops the match as a plugin bug.
- **Why:** One code path to test. Async lets simultaneous players call their
  models in parallel later, while the log order stays the seat order.
- **Alternatives:** A loop per turn mode; batches of actions per request (may
  come with the agent runner if model calls need it).

## D-013 · High Card as a shipped reference game

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** `games/toy` is a real plugin (a small trick-taking game), not a
  test fixture.
- **Why:** It is the game the CLI runs before a real game exists, and the
  template `CLAUDE.md` points to for adding a game.
- **Alternatives:** A fixture under `tests/` only.

## D-014 · asyncpg and SQL migration files, no ORM

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** Postgres access uses asyncpg with plain SQL. Schema changes are
  numbered `.sql` files in `arena/db/migrations/`, applied in order inside one
  transaction and recorded in `schema_migrations`; an advisory lock keeps two
  processes from migrating at once. The arena applies them at startup.
- **Why:** The data model is an append-only event table plus a few lookup
  tables later; SQL says that more directly than an ORM mapping. The engine is
  async, so the driver is too. A migration runner of thirty lines is easier to
  read than an Alembic setup for forward-only migrations.
- **Alternatives:** SQLAlchemy with Alembic; psycopg 3 (its async mode needs a
  different event loop on Windows).

## D-015 · The log is stored once per turn, and replay is strict about versions

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** A match hands its new events to the store after setup, after
  every completed turn and at the end, each batch in one transaction with
  explicit positions (`match_id`, `seq` is the primary key). `replay` refuses a
  log whose game id or plugin version differs from the plugin it is given.
- **Why:** A stored log then always ends at a turn boundary, so a crashed match
  can be replayed to a state the game really had, and a second writer for the
  same match fails instead of interleaving. A plugin of another version may
  apply old events differently; failing loudly beats a silently wrong state.
  The stored events themselves stay readable for any version.
- **Alternatives:** One write per event (a crash could cut a turn in half);
  replaying across versions and hoping.

## D-016 · Event data is plain JSON, enforced at emit

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** The engine rejects a game event whose data would change in a
  JSON round trip (tuples, non-string keys) and stops the match with a plugin
  error.
- **Why:** The live state is built from the same events that are stored. If
  storage changed an event, a replay would differ from the match. Checking at
  emit finds this in every bot match, without a database.
- **Alternatives:** Normalising silently; finding it only in database tests.

## D-017 · Database tests use a real Postgres, one schema per test

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Decision:** Tests under `tests/db/` connect to the Compose database on
  `127.0.0.1:5433` (or `ARENA_TEST_DATABASE_URL`), each in a fresh schema that
  is dropped afterwards. Without a reachable server they are skipped locally;
  with `CI` set they fail. CI starts Postgres as a service container.
- **Why:** The store is SQL, so only the real database proves it. Schemas keep
  tests independent of each other and of development data.
- **Alternatives:** Mocking the driver; an in-memory fake store; testcontainers.
